# Github API Assistant

This repository holds a Github assistant API based on the GPT3.5 model of OpenAI.
The application is developed using FastAPI and OpenAI's API. It is containerized using Docker, which means it can be easily set up and run on any system with Docker installed. The repository also includes some unit and integration tests that can be run inside the Docker container.


## Features
  - Refresh the stored GitHub API file
  - Refresh the GitHub API's embeddings
  - Ask chatGPT-3.5 a question regarding GitHub's API stored in the container

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (or just [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- You have an OpenAI API key, to be able to connect to the chatGPT 3.5. If not, you can get one here: [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api)


## Running the Application

To run the Todo List API, follow these steps:

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tntath/api-assistant.git

# Navigate into the directory
cd api-assistant

# Create a .env file and add the line below
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your own OpenAI key>

# Start the Docker containers
docker-compose up -d
```

## API Documentation

Once the Docker containers are up and running, you can visit the Swagger UI to interact with the API: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

It is automatically generated by the FastAPI framework and includes API documentation and input validation.

There you can use the various endpoints to test all the features.

## Running Tests

To run the test suite, you can execute the following command:

```bash
# Running the test suite
docker-compose exec web pytest . -v
```

## Next Steps

The next steps for this project could be:

- Connect the API to a proper UI
- Rate limiting and caching to reduce redundant API calls to the LLM.
- User authentication for personalized recommendations.
- Add more tests. 

Please note that this project is an implementation of a coding challenge and is meant for demonstration purposes only.
